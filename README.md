# GavelScript
This is a small single-header embeddable scripting language with an emphasis on [embeddability](#capi) and human-readability. This is still very much an experimental language, so please don't use this in actual projects yet haha.

> NOTICE: A major rewrite is planned for the VM and parser (mostly the parser lol) because performance right now is actually ~13x slower than Lua 5.3 LOL. Anyways see you then!
